To run Ubuntu effectively, you need a laptop or PC with at least 25 GB of storage space, a 2 GHz dual-core processor, and at least 4 GB of RAM, along with an 8 GB USB flash drive for creating the installation media and a stable internet connection for downloading updates and additional software. For a smoother experience, the recommended specifications include a 2 GHz quad-core processor or better, 8 GB or more of RAM, at least 25 GB of free space (ideally 50 GB or more), a graphics card that supports 3D acceleration, and a display with a resolution of at least 1366x768. Additionally, ensure that your hardware components (such as Wi-Fi adapters and printers) have Linux drivers available, and if your computer uses UEFI firmware, make sure it is configured correctly for Ubuntu installation.
